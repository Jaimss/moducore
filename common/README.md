# common module

The **Common** module contains lots of things that may need to be accessed between other modules. Many utility
functions are here.

Try to use abstractions here or identifiers so spigot / jda don't need to be dependencies.

Ex. Use a `Long` to represent Discord users or a `UUID` to represent a Minecraft user.
