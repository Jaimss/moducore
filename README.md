# ModuCore

A Highly Customizable & Modular Core Plugin

### Modular
Just about everything that can be a module is, meaning that you can disable or enable just about any feature of the plugin. Often times, you can
disable features "on the fly" without a server restart. This makes it a great core plugin to start out with, because as you develop your own
plugins, it is very easy to wean your server off of ModuCore if you ever choose to do so. 

### Customization
ModuCore is built for freedom and customization. I decided to write this plugin after experiencing issues with CMI when I was starting out. 
A lot of the "modules" that CMI had actually didn't work, and it caused issues when I tried to remove the plugin from my server. 
ModuCore is built for your freedom, so you can modify about any feature of the plugin, the messages it sends, etc. You can also use the Developer API
to use ModuCore's features in your plugin. ModuCore also provides many PlaceholderAPI placeholders allowing you to use data from ModuCore in your other 
plugins.

### Free and Open Source
ModuCore will forever be free and open source, so you can clone it and make any changes you want yourself. You will always have access to the latest
jar for free on the releases page of this github.

### Support
We offer support at James' Discord ([discord.jaims.dev](https://discord.jaims.dev)). The [wiki](https://github.com/Jaimss/moducore/wiki) is also 
very detailed and provides information about the plugin as well as the Devloper API. If you do have any questions, please join the discord and
ask away!
